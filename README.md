# FizzBuzz

> My implementation of the FizzBuzz challenge.

### What is FizzBuzz?
It is a simple game.

You start counting 1, 2, 3, ...
Each time you reach a multiple of 3, you replace the number with the word "Fizz".
When you reach a multiple of 5, you replace the number with the word "Buzz".
Oh, and if you reach a multiple of 3 and 5, you replace the word with "FizzBuzz".

Those are the rules.
